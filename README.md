# SIS-Model
This is a simple SIS model written in Matlab
First, download all three codes sismodel.m, SISpplan.m and SISsolver.m in a folder.
Then run the code SISsolver. This code needs the sismodel.m or else it will not run
The code SISpplane.m plots the phase plane of the SIS model and creates an animation of the changes to the phase plane when the parameter alpha is changed.
